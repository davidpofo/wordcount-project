# Word Count Visualizer Project
This is a django web app I made for practice. This project uses the web framework django, visualizes the word count data with bokeh, styles with bootstrap, and is deployed on the cloud platform heroku. You can check it out [here](https://django-wordcount-project.herokuapp.com/).
